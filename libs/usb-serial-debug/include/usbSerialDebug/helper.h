 * These helpers write directly to CDC interface 0 using TinyUSB.
 * They are thread-safe (use a mutex internally) and designed to avoid
 * blocking forever. Do not call them from ISRs or TinyUSB callbacks.

 * @note This API does not use pico_stdio_usb. Keep CDC0 free for this writer.
 * @note You must run TinyUSB in a task (e.g., a task that calls tud_task()).
